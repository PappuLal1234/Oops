# Coffee Machine Simulator

This is a Coffee Machine Simulator implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows you to manage a virtual coffee machine with various features.

## Features

### Buy Coffee
- You can purchase different types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
- Each coffee type has its own price and requires specific amounts of ingredients (water, milk, and coffee beans).
- The coffee will be dispensed only if there are enough ingredients in the machine.
- If there aren't enough ingredients, an error message will be displayed.

### Fill Ingredients
- You can refill the coffee machine with ingredients.
- Specify the amount of water (in ml), milk (in ml), and coffee beans (in g) to add to the machine.

### Take Money
- You can take the money collected from coffee sales from the machine's money box.

### Show Ingredients
- View the current quantities of water, milk, coffee beans, and the money in the machine.

### Analytics
- Get detailed statistics about the coffee sales:
  - The count of each coffee type sold (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
  - Total money earned from sales.
  - The amount of ingredients consumed (water, milk, and coffee beans) due to sales.

### Exit
- You can exit the simulation at any time.
